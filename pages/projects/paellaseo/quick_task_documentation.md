This document maintains a structured record of ongoing, pending, and completed tasks for the development of the paellaSEO extension. It serves as a roadmap for the project and helps coordinate the efforts of the development team.

## Task Management System

### Task Identification
Each task has a unique identifier with the format:
- `TASK-[Category]-[Number]` where:
  - `Category` is a 3-letter code for the task type (DEV, UI, TEST, DOC, etc.)
  - `Number` is a sequential value for the category

### Task States
- **Pending**: Task identified but not started
- **In Analysis**: Evaluating requirements and approach
- **In Development**: Active work in progress
- **In Testing**: Functionality verification
- **Blocked**: Waiting for external dependencies
- **Completed**: Implemented and verified

### Task Priorities
- **Critical**: Essential for basic functionality, blocks other tasks
- **High**: Important for main functionalities
- **Medium**: Useful but does not block general progress
- **Low**: Desirable but can be postponed

### Task Estimation
We use a point scale to estimate the necessary effort:
- **XS**: Less than 2 hours (1 point)
- **S**: Half day (2 points)
- **M**: 1 day (3 points)
- **L**: 2-3 days (5 points)
- **XL**: 1 week (8 points)
- **XXL**: More than 1 week (13 points)

## Sprint Planning

### Current Sprint: Sprint 1 (17/06/2024 - 30/06/2024)
