# paellaSEO Bug Registry

Central reference for tracking known bugs in the paellaSEO extension, detailing their statuses, resolution plans, and history of solved issues.

## Bug Tracking System

All bugs in paellaSEO are tracked using a standardized system to ensure proper documentation, prioritization, and resolution. Each bug is assigned a unique identifier and tracked through its lifecycle.

### Bug ID Convention

Each bug is assigned a unique ID with the format: `BUG-YYYYMMDD-XX`

- `YYYYMMDD`: Date when the bug was reported
- `XX`: Sequential number for bugs reported on the same day

## Active Bugs

### BUG-20240315-01

**Title:** Keyword density calculation incorrect for non-English content

**Status:** Open

**Priority:** High

**Reported:** March 15, 2024

**Description:**
The keyword density calculation algorithm fails to accurately measure keyword frequency in non-English content, particularly for languages with different character sets or grammatical structures. This results in inaccurate SEO recommendations for non-English websites.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Create a page with Spanish, French, or German content
2. Add keywords with accented characters (á, é, ü, etc.)
3. Run the keyword density analysis
4. Compare results with manual calculation

**Expected Behavior:**
Keyword density should be calculated correctly regardless of language or character set.

**Actual Behavior:**
Density calculations are 15-30% lower than actual for non-English content.

**Technical Details:**
- Affects all non-Latin character sets
- Most severe with Cyrillic, Arabic, and Asian languages
- Related to the text normalization function in `src/analysis/keyword-density.js`

**Resolution Plan:**
1. Implement Unicode-aware text normalization
2. Add language detection to adjust analysis algorithms
3. Create test cases for multiple languages
4. Expected fix in version 1.2.0

### BUG-20240315-02

**Title:** Meta tag analyzer crashes with long descriptions

**Status:** In Progress

**Priority:** Medium

**Reported:** March 15, 2024

**Description:**
When analyzing meta descriptions longer than 320 characters, the extension occasionally crashes or returns incorrect truncation recommendations. This affects users who need to analyze pages with verbose meta descriptions.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Create a page with a meta description exceeding 320 characters
2. Run the meta tag analyzer
3. Observe crash or incorrect recommendations

**Technical Details:**
- Error occurs in `src/analyzers/meta-analyzer.js`
- Related to string handling in the truncation suggestion algorithm
- Affects approximately 5% of analysis operations

**Resolution Plan:**
1. Implement proper string length handling
2. Add error boundaries around the meta analysis component
3. Fix scheduled for version 1.1.5 (in development)
4. Current workaround: Manually truncate descriptions before analysis

**Assigned To:** Developer Team

**Title:** Incorrect heading structure recommendations

**Status:** Resolved (v1.1.0)

**Priority:** High

**Reported:** March 1, 2024

**Priority:** Critical

**Reported:** February 20, 2024

The extension would fail to initialize properly on Firefox browsers (versions 115-120), showing only a blank interface. This was caused by incompatible JavaScript syntax in the initialization module.

**Resolution:**
- Identified incompatible optional chaining syntax
- Replaced with compatible alternatives
- Added Firefox-specific test suite
- Fixed in emergency patch v1.0.5 (released February 22, 2024)
