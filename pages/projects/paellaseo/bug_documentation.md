This documentation maintains a detailed record of known bugs in the paellaSEO extension, their current status, resolution plans, and the history of solved issues. This document serves as a central reference for tracking problems during the development and maintenance of the extension.

## Bug Tracking System

### Naming Convention
All bugs must have a unique ID following the format:
- `BUG-YYYYMMDD-XX` where:
  - `YYYYMMDD` is the date the bug was identified
  - `XX` is a two-digit sequential number (starting at 01) for bugs reported on the same day

### Cycle of a Bug
1. **Identification**: The bug is detected and documented
2. **Analysis**: The root cause is investigated and possible solutions are evaluated
3. **Prioritization**: The bug is assigned a priority and its resolution is scheduled
4. **Resolution**: The solution is implemented
5. **Verification**: It is verified that the bug has been resolved correctly
6. **Closure**: The solution is documented and the bug is closed

### Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Prevents basic functionality of the extension, affects security, or may cause data loss
- **High**: Significantly affects the main functionality of the extension
- **Medium**: Affects secondary functionalities or has alternative solutions
- **Low**: Minor errors, UI/UX non-critical issues

### Bug Categories
- **Functional**: Related to the logic of main functionalities
- **UI/UX**: Problems with interface and user experience
- **Performance**: Speed, memory, or resource problems
- **Security**: Vulnerabilities or data exposure
- **Compatibility**: Problems specific to certain browsers or systems
- **Data**: Errors in processing, storage, or data analysis
- **Environment**: Problems related to development or deployment environment

## Open Bugs

### Functional

#### [BUG-20240617-01] The analyzer does not detect multiple H1 tags correctly

**Description**: The content structure analyzer does not mark as an error when a page has multiple H1 tags, which is not recommended for SEO.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Open the extension on a page with multiple H1 tags
2. Run the full analysis
3. Review the "Content Structure" section in the results

**Expected Behavior**: The system should identify and mark as error the presence of multiple H1 tags, suggesting to keep only one.

**Actual Behavior**: The system does not detect the problem and does not show any warning about multiple H1 tags.

**Environment Information**:
- Chrome Version: 114.0.5735.198
- Operating System: Windows 11
- paellaSEO Version: 0.1.0 (development)

**Category**: Functional

**Priority**: High

**Status**: In Analysis

**Assigned To**: To be assigned

**Identification Date**: 2024-06-17

**Resolution Date**: Pending

**Additional Notes**: This problem directly affects the accuracy of SEO analysis, as having multiple H1s is considered a bad practice that can negatively affect positioning.

### UI/UX

#### [BUG-20240617-02] Recommendations interface does not adjust correctly on small screens

**Description**: The interface that shows SEO improvement recommendations does not adapt correctly to screens with resolution less than 1280x800px, causing some elements to be outside the view or overlap.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Open the extension on a browser with screen resolution below 1280x800px
2. Navigate to the "Recommendations" tab
3. Observe how the elements of the interface are displayed

**Expected Behavior**: The interface should adapt responsively, showing all elements correctly without overlap or content loss.

**Actual Behavior**: The elements of the recommendations panel overlap and some buttons are partially outside the view.

**Screenshots**: [Pending to include]

**Environment Information**:
- Chrome Version: 115.0.5790.102
- Operating System: macOS Monterey
- paellaSEO Version: 0.1.0 (development)

**Category**: UI/UX

**Priority**: Medium

**Status**: Open

**Assigned To**: To be assigned

**Identification Date**: 2024-06-17

**Resolution Date**: Pending

### Performance

#### [BUG-20240617-03] Excessive analysis time on pages with many images

**Description**: Analysis time increases exponentially on pages with more than 50 images, taking more than 20 seconds to complete or even blocking.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Visit a page with a large number of images (e.g., a photo gallery)
2. Start the full SEO analysis
3. Measure the time it takes to complete

**Expected Behavior**: The analysis should complete in a reasonable time (less than 5 seconds) regardless of the number of images, possibly implementing batch analysis.

**Actual Behavior**: The analysis takes more than 20 seconds, and in some cases the interface temporarily freezes.

**Environment Information**:
- Chrome Version: 114.0.5735.198
- Operating System: Linux Ubuntu 22.04
- paellaSEO Version: 0.1.0 (development)

**Category**: Performance

**Priority**: High

**Status**: In Analysis

**Assigned To**: To be assigned

**Identification Date**: 2024-06-17

**Resolution Date**: Pending

**Additional Notes**: Initial investigation suggests that the problem may be related to how alt attributes and image dimensions are processed. Batch processing or asynchronous processing is being considered.
