## Technical Architecture and Development Environment

paellaSEO is built with a modern technology stack that prioritizes efficiency and performance:

### Development Stack
- **Bun**: Used as a package manager and JavaScript runtime, completely replacing npm.
- **Vite**: Ultra-fast build framework for project bundling, instead of Webpack.
- **TypeScript**: Implemented for static typing and better maintainability.
- **ESM (ECMAScript Modules)**: Used for better organization and code modularity.

### Technical Stack Advantages
- **Superior Performance**: Bun offers installation and compilation times up to 10x faster than npm.
- **Efficient Development**: Instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR) thanks to Vite.
- **Lower Memory Footprint**: Resource optimization during development and in production.
- **Modern Compatibility**: Focus on current and future web standards.

This technical approach allows the development team to iterate quickly and ensures that the extension maintains optimal performance for end users.
