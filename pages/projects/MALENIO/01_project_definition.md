## Project Vision

MALENIO will transform Gmail users' ability to manage and discover email patterns through intelligent, privacy-preserving AI that operates locally using Ollama. By providing smart auto-tagging, pattern recognition, and organizational capabilities, MALENIO will reduce email management time while improving information retrieval and workflow integration.

## Core Problem

Email overload and inefficient categorization lead to:
- Information buried in overflowing inboxes
- Inconsistent manual tagging practices
- Privacy concerns with cloud-based AI email analysis
- Time wasted on email organization and retrieval
- Difficulty identifying important patterns in communication

MALENIO addresses these challenges by providing intelligent, local-AI powered organization that learns from user behavior while preserving privacy.

## Project Goals

1. **Primary Goal**: Create a Chrome extension that enhances Gmail management through AI-powered auto-tagging and pattern recognition using local Ollama models.

2. **Secondary Goals**:
   - Improve email discovery and retrieval speed by 50%+
   - Reduce manual tagging and organization time by 75%
   - Maintain complete privacy by processing all data locally
   - Enable users to discover valuable insights and patterns in their emails
   - Provide a seamless, intuitive extension of Gmail's native interface

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- Chrome extension development for Gmail
- Local AI integration with Ollama
- Email analysis and auto-tagging capabilities
