## Project Overview

MALENIO is a Chrome extension designed to revolutionize Gmail management and discovery patterns using advanced AI for auto-tagging emails. The solution leverages local AI models through Ollama, ensuring privacy and performance while delivering intelligent email organization capabilities.

### Vision Statement

MALENIO aims to transform how users interact with their Gmail inbox by providing AI-powered organization that respects privacy above all else. We believe users shouldn't have to choose between powerful AI assistance and keeping their email data private.

### Unique Value Proposition

MALENIO stands apart as the first Gmail enhancement tool that delivers sophisticated AI email management capabilities without sending any user data to the cloud. By processing all data locally through Ollama, MALENIO offers:

- Complete privacy protection - your emails never leave your device
- Intelligent organization without privacy trade-offs
- Personalized email management that adapts to your unique workflow
- Transparent AI decision-making under user control

- Learning from user tagging behavior
- Consistent taxonomy enforcement
- Zero cloud data transmission

### 2. Pattern Recognition
- Identification of communication patterns across conversations
- Highlighting of important trends in your inbox
- Relationship mapping between senders, topics, and projects
- Visual analytics of email communication patterns

### 3. Local AI Processing
- Integration with Ollama for local model inference
- No email content sent to external services
- Model selection based on user hardware capabilities
- Works offline once models are downloaded

### 4. Gmail Integration
- Native-feeling UI extensions
- Keyboard shortcuts and workflow enhancements
- Gmail search integration with AI-generated tags
- Minimal performance impact on Gmail experience

### 5. Privacy Controls
- Granular control over AI processing
